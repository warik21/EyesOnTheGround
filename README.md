## Description
This package is used in order to take a few observatories and understand the pieces of land each of them covers, in order to have a better grasp on what we can see by using them.
The package can also take a few observatory points and settings and recommend how to use them in the best way.

## Usage
Add observatory settings in eriktron/src/Observatiories and run "main"
